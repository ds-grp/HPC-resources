# Python HPC "HPyC" Package
https://github.com/aimerson/HPyC

Here is a small package for submitting and managing HPC jobs using python. There is currently very little documentation included in the modules, but there is an *examples* subdirectory with some example scripts demonstrating the basic usage. Modules are available for PBS (and SLURM, though this module needs revising).
